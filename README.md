# CHAT-APPLICATION

COMPANY: CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: D M KARTHIK

INTERN ID: CITSOD783

DOMAIN: FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT

DURATION: 6 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

During my internship, I worked on a web-based Live Chat Application using Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO, hosted on the Replit platform. This was my first hands-on experience building a full-stack application from scratch. The objective of the project was to create a real-time messaging interface where users could send and receive messages instantly without refreshing the page.

I used Replit as the development environment, which allowed me to code, run, and preview the application entirely in the browser without any local setup. I created three main files: index.html for the frontend UI, index.js for server-side logic using Express and Socket.IO, and package.json for managing dependencies. After setting up the server and writing the client-side socket code, I tested the chat by opening the app in two tabs and observed successful real-time communication.

Through this project, I gained practical exposure to web sockets, event-based programming, and full-stack deevelopment. I also became more confident using cloud-based IDEs like Replit and learned how to debug live applications. This internship task improved my understanding of how real-time systems work and helped me enhance my problem-solving and coding skills.
